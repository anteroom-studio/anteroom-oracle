ZAI Oracle — Regime Detector
by Zawwar (github.com/Zawwarsami16)

"Volatile" is not a regime. It's a cop-out.

This module classifies the ACTUAL market regime from a defined set
of states that have real historical precedent and distinct behaviors.
Each regime has known characteristics, typical durations, and
what usually happens next.

Regimes are mutually exclusive — the system picks the dominant one
based on weighted signals, then shows the drivers.

This is what Bloomberg-level systems do:
they don't say "markets are uncertain"
they say "RISK-OFF / WAR PREMIUM — Oil breakout, VIX elevated"
"""

# REGIME DEFINITIONS

# - typical characteristics
# - what usually happens to each asset class
# - historical examples
